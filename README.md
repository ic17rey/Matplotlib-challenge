# Matplotlib Challenge 

The Power of Plots

This challenge analyzes data collected from the study of 249 mice that have been treated with a number of different drug regimens.The data for the study was collected over 45 days, and an analysis is needed to identify the most promising treatments. There are two csv files saved in the data folder for this challenge and these are merged together to create tables and plot figures analyzing the data. 

Specifically, the code for this challenge identifies and removes from the data any mice ids of concern (with duplication for measurements). A summary statistics table for the tumor volumes for each drug regimen over the length of the study is created with the data that remains.

Plots of the data are created to analyze the total number of measurements taken per drug regimen (with one pandas plot and one pyplot) and to evaluate the number of female and male mice in the study. A mouse treated with Capomulin is chosen and evaluated in a line plot of tumor volume over time. A scatter plot of tumor volume and mouse weight is created for the mice treated with Capomulin (one of the more promising of the drug regimens).

Additional study for the data used in the scatter plot is needed to calculate the correlation coefficient and linear regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume (and plot). Calculations are also to be done on final tumor volume for each mouse for the four treatments: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin. Matplotlib plots for this data is requested to examine outliers.

For the analysis and plots that were completed observations are made at the top of notebook.
